**Can I run it in collab?**

Yes, see a rudimentary example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/194wo-G5fCZmqIFt0BDXZcpDpdlbU9Yns). If you are a colab ninja and want your example to appear here, please ping us!

**I get an error related to `tkinter` when installing the requirements. What shall I do?**

You need to install it in your operative system. In Ubuntu, do that: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.
